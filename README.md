# 🤖 The Grim Reaper - Langchain RAG 

In this repo, you'll find a pretty entertaining RAG application the can be used for talking to any data set, using Langchain, OpenAI, text-3-embedding small, GPT-3.5-turbo, the FAISS vectorstore, and an extra component: visibility tooling with WandB. In this notebook, we'll use the NVIDIA 10-k Filings and ask "The Grim Reaper" some questions.
